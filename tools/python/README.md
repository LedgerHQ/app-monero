## Seed Recovery

### Goals

The 24 master seed words (BIP39/BIP32) of your device is enough to keep safe your Monero
in case you loose or break your device:  get a new device, set it with your 24 words, 
install Monero application: your funds are here!

Now imagine you need to access your funds in emergency and cannot wait for a new device. 
The solution is to restore your wallet as a standard wallet with the 25 seed electrum words.

For that, this tools is what you need: It convert the 24 seed words to 25 Electrum/Monero seed words.

This convertion can be made in tow manner: offline and online.

**Offline:**

You do not need your device, just your 24 words. This way is insecure as you will have to enter
your 24 master words on the computer and the 25 Electrum seed will be display on the same computer.

**Online:** 

You need your device. This way is secure as you will have not to enter your 24 master words on the computer
and your 25 Electrum seed will be display only on your device.

Once got, you can write down those 25 words alongside with your 24 master seed words.
